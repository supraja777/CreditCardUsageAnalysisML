Credit Card Usage Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing credit card usage patterns to gain insights into customer behavior and segmentation within a financial institution. By understanding customer preferences and spending habits, businesses can tailor their services and marketing strategies more effectively to enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Extensive EDA was performed to gain insights into the dataset, including visualizations of credit card usage features.
Techniques such as histograms, pairplots, and correlation analysis were used to understand the distribution and relationships among variables.

K-Means clustering was applied to segment customers based on their credit card usage patterns.
The optimal number of clusters was determined using the Elbow method to ensure meaningful segmentation.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was employed to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while preserving its essential information.
Dimensionality reduction facilitated visualization and interpretation of customer segmentation


Results

Customer Segmentation
Clustering analysis revealed distinct customer segments based on credit card usage behavior.
Each cluster exhibited unique characteristics, such as spending habits, payment patterns, and credit limit usage.
